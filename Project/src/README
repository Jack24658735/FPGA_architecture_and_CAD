For the directory mentioned by TA, I put all source files and makefile in "src" folder.
So, you need to navigate to src folder first.
1. How to compile
Under this directory, use the “make” command.
$ make
Then, it will compile my work by g++.

2. How to execute (calculate running time also)
Enter command such as following to execute project file. (Note: I use the “time” program in Linux to calculate my running time)
$ time project <.arch file> <.module file> <.net file> <.floorplan file>

<.arch file>: the absolute or relative path of input .arch file.
<.module file>: the absolute or relative path of input .module file.
<.net file>: the absolute or relative path of input .net file.
<.floorplan file>: the absolute or relative path of output .floorplan file.
